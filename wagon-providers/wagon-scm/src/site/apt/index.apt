Maven Wagon SCM

 This project is an implementation of Wagon provider for SCM (Source Control Management) systems,
 using {{{http://maven.apache.org/scm}Maven SCM}}.
 
 It enables Maven to use remote repositories stored in SCM systems (Subversion, CVS, ...)
 and to store Maven sites in SCMs.


Features

 * Deploy files and directories to several SCM using Maven SCM (only tested with CVS and SVN)
 
 * Get files from several SCM using Maven SCM (only tested with CVS and SVN)


Known issues

 * If the file is changed by the SCM the checksum calculation may not work

   * SVN: when a file has properties svn:eol-style or svn:keywords set

   * CVS: when keywords are expanded
